Embedding with GenomeOcean-4B-bgcFM.py and Embedding with GenomeOcean-4BM.py are example scripts that we used GenomeOcean models embedding our sequences. (Notices: in this code, we only select the 3000 sequences as an examples, when you use it, please make sure you have revise it accordingly.)


“positive_pairs.csv” this is the final positive datasets after cleaning, both chromosomes and plasmids are noted as their Accession Number in NCBI RefSeq Database
"Supplementary_2.csv" is the original dataset we download at [Maddamsetti, R., Shyti, I., Wilson, M. L., Son, H. I., Baig, Y., Zhou, Z., ... & You, L. (2025). Scaling laws of bacterial and archaeal plasmids. Nature Communications, 16(1), 6023.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61205-2).
